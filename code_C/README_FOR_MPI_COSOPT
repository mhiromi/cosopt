This is README for MPI COSOPT. 

1) Setting source codes
Copy this directory under your home directory (for example, /home/username/) and create two files, mpd.hosts and .rhosts.

2) Settings of ".mpd.conf" file

Make ".mpdf.conf" file under your home directory. 
The file should be included:
----------
secretword="put your password"
----------

Then, 
chmod 600 .mpd.conf

3) Running your job on MPI 

Run mpd.
/bin/mpdboot --rsh=rsh -n `wc -l ~/mpd.hosts|awk '{print $1;}'` -f ~/mpd.hosts

To compile COSOPT, run the following command under the COSOPT directory. 
/home/username/bin/mpicc mpi_cosopt.c -o mpi_cosopt -lm -ldsfmt -lsfmt -L/home/username/lib -I/home/username/include -O3

Then, run make all

To kill a process of MPI, please use "mpdlistjobs" or "mpdkilljob" commands. 

To kill "mpd" itself, please use "mpdallexit" command. 

4) How to assign SGE/UGE to hundle  a job
 
Please call mpicalc.pl in a job script for SGE.

Usage)
./mpicalc.pl [path of your data file] [name of output] [number of iterations]

Example) 
./mpicalc.pl /home/username/gene_exrpression_data.csv /home/username/cosopt/result 2
In this case, you will find two output  files of COSOPT,  result_1.txt and result_2.txt,  in /home/username/cosopt/ directory.
